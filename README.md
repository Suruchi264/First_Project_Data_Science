## Title of the Project - Forest Fire Prediction Model(Regression-based predictive model)





🔹 Purpose of the Project

The goal was to create a regression-based predictive model that could analyze historical data, identify relationships between variables, and forecast target outcomes with high accuracy. This project not only strengthened my grasp on regression concepts but also taught me how to structure a full Data Science workflow from scratch.





🔹 Objectives

1) Ingest and preprocess raw datasets for regression modeling.

2) Apply Simple Linear Regression to study one-to-one variable relationships.

3) Apply Multiple Linear Regression to capture multi-variable dependencies.

4) Train, evaluate, and compare both models on real datasets.

5) Interpret coefficients, R², and error metrics to assess performance.





🔹 Step-by-Step Implementation



1️⃣ Data Ingestion – Loaded the dataset from CSV files, handled missing values, and ensured schema alignment.



2️⃣ Data Preprocessing –

a) Removed null/duplicate records.

b) Encoded categorical features (if any).

c) Scaled numerical features for better regression performance.



3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) –

a) Visualized variable relationships using scatter plots & correlation matrices.

b) Identified strong predictors for the target variable.



4️⃣ Model Development –

a) Simple Linear Regression: Built to analyze the relationship between one independent and one dependent variable.

b) Multiple Linear Regression: Incorporated multiple predictors to improve forecasting accuracy.



5️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation –

a) Split dataset into training/testing sets.

b) Trained models and evaluated them using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score.



6️⃣ Insights & Interpretation –

a) Compared performance of both regression models.

b) Interpreted coefficients to understand variable impact.



🔹 Output

a) Achieved strong predictive accuracy with Multiple Linear Regression outperforming the simple version.

b) Generated a detailed performance report with error metrics and visualizations of predicted vs actual values.

c) Built an interpretable model that can be adapted for similar regression-based use cases in business.
